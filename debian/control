Description: boot manager for EFI-based computers
 A graphical boot manager for EFI- and UEFI-based computers, such as all
 Intel-based Macs and recent (most 2011 and later) PCs. rEFInd presents a
 boot menu showing all the EFI boot loaders on the EFI-accessible
 partitions, and optionally BIOS-bootable partitions on Macs.
 EFI-compatbile OSes, including Linux, provide boot loaders that rEFInd can
 detect and launch. rEFInd can launch Linux EFI boot loaders such as ELILO,
 GRUB Legacy, GRUB 2, and 3.3.0 and later kernels with EFI stub support.
 EFI filesystem drivers for ext2/3/4fs, ReiserFS, Btrfs, HFS+, and ISO-9660
 enable rEFInd to read boot loaders from these filesystems, too. rEFInd's
 ability to detect boot loaders at runtime makes it very easy to use,
 particularly when paired with Linux kernels that provide EFI stub support.
